# Clue Solver

**Solver for the board game Clue.**

*Clue Solver* provides the user with a GUI intended to be used during a Clue game, so that the program can help the user in making deductions (e.g.: understand which cards are held by a certain adversary player, etc.): the user must continously insert new information in the program (e.g.: which cards are searched by another player during an inquery phase and which player showed him a card, etc.) to allow the program to make deductions; the user can use the GUI of the program to check which new information the program as discovered, so that he can use this new knowledge to better play a Clue play.

Note: the official name of the software program is *Clue Solver*, but to avoid problems with the space character in the name, the project and repository name is *Clue_Solver* (with an underscore instead of the space).
