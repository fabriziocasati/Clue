# Clue Solver

**Solver for the board game Clue.**

*Clue Solver* provides the user with a GUI intended to be used during a Clue game, so that *Clue Solver* can help the user in making deductions (e.g.: understand which cards are held by a certain adversary player, etc.): the user must continously insert new information in *Clue Solver* (e.g.: which cards are searched by another player during an inquery phase and which player showed him a card, etc.), by means of the GUI, to allow *Clue Solver* to make deductions; the user can use the GUI of *Clue Solver* also to check which deductions the program has successfully made up to now, so that he can use this new knowledge to better play a Clue play.

Note: the official name of the software program is *Clue Solver*, but to avoid problems with the space character in the name during computations, the Qt project and the GitHub repository are named *Clue_Solver* (i.e., an underscore replaces the space).
